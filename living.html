	<p>As I said before I live in a hidden village within a garden.  the environment here can be so peaceful and so hectic at the same time. most of the other villagers here are also little fairies like me but there are some bugs that live here too. the dynamic of everybody that lives here it's so perfect it almost feels as if we were all supposed to be here. I love being surrounded by tall grass and plants and just wandering around exploring new areas of the land.</p>
