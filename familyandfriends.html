<p>Here you can see all my friends. first, we have Juana who is a lovable ladybug. she comes with me every time I decided to go on a crazy trip. I feel she's almost like a good luck charm. next, we have Molly who is another fairy. she's more of the Troublemaker of the group. There's not a day where she comes to me and Juana to talk about a crazy experience she had with one of the villagers. lastly, we have hash who is an anxious caterpillar. hash definitely loves to stay more indoors than all of us combined. He finds peace Within paste little leaf bed. Whenever we have him tag-along, I can say he freaks out at least once. all together we make a perfect group that balances each other out.</p>
