	<p>Hi! My name is Nira :) Welcome again! I am a little fairy who lives in a small village that is hidden within a garden,(to be honest it's probably someone's backyard but that sounds lameâ€¦ and don't ask how I got access to a computer). I'll keep this short and sweet but here are some fun facts about me are: 
1. I love to go on crazy adventures either by myself or with my friends
2. I love to collect flower peddles and create new looks for my wardrobe
3. Lastly, I love a good rainy day to sleep in 
Hopefully you will stick around to hear some of my wild stories or even experience some with me :D</p>
